### Full stops (.)

Do not use full stops after after email addresses that end sentences as they may be misread.

{% include guide_example.liquid title = "email addresses" content= "
You can email the department at example@department.gov.au " %}

Use full stops for other kinds of hyperlinks that end sentences. The link text should form part of the sentence.

{% include guide_example.liquid title = "form download" content= "
Download a form from our HR team at Department of Example. " %}
