### Full stops (.)

Do not use full stops after after email addresses that end sentences as they may be misread.

Example
You can email the department at example@department.gov.au

Use full stops for other kinds of hyperlinks that end sentences. The link text should form part of the sentence.


Example
Download a form from our HR team at Department of Example.
