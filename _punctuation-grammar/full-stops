Do not use full stops after after email addresses that end sentences as they may be misread.

{% include guide_example.liquid title = "email address link at end of sentence" content= "
You can email the department at [example@department.gov.au](#)" %}

Use full stops for other kinds of hyperlinks that end sentences. The link text should form part of the sentence.

{% include guide_example.liquid title = "link at end of sentence" content= "
The People team manage the [add a new employee form](#)." %}
