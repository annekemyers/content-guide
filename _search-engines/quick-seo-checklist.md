### Page content

- Use clear introductions, conclusions and topics to organise content into paragraphs.
- Check for correct spelling and grammar. Cite any sources properly using internal or external links.
- Use keywords naturally throughout your content.
- Use synonyms that Google uses to determine a page’s relevancy.

### URL path

- The website page’s URL should include the main keywords for that page.
- Each word in the URL should be separated using dashes (-) and lower case.
- Length: try to keep it below 100 characters

### Title tags

- Describe what the page is about and use tags that are unique to each page. 
- Use your main keywords.
- Length: about 60-70 characters

### Meta description tag

- Use a description that accurately summarises the page content and is unique to each page. 
- Use keywords to create a compelling description that a searcher will want to click on.
- Length: 150-160 characters long

### Header tags

- The `h1` heading tag gives users a quick overview of the content on the page. It should support the keyword theme from the metadata and use the main keywords. 
- Adding `h2` and `h3` heading tags helps structure your content more clearly. Try to include main keywords in at least 1 subheading and keyword variations in lower headings.

### Images

- Include descriptive captions and keywords in the image `alt` tag, caption and file name.

### Internal links

- Link to other pages on your website as appropriate.
- Try to include 2 to 3 links in every page.
- Make sure your links use keywords in the link text that is relevant to the page it’s linked to.
