Keywords are the common terms people use when searching for information. They should be user-focused, relevant and consistent.

Research with users to find the keywords that they will use to find the information and click through to your page.

### Keyword research

The first step in SEO is to know what it is you’re optimising for. This means knowing the words people are searching. These are the keywords you want your website pages to rank for. You can then use those keywords to write content that answers those queries.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "selecting keywords"
  content= "
You website helps users become Australia citizens.

You have researched with users who are keen to become Australian citizens. You have found they use the keyword 'citizenship' a lot.

You will want to include 'citizenship' a few times in the opening paragraphs of your content, in your meta title, meta description and URL."

### How to work out which keywords to use

You can find out which keywords to use through keyword research with users.

Tools like [Google's AdWords Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/){:rel="external"} or [Keyword Tool](https://keywordtool.io/){:rel="external"} will also suggest keywords you can use. These tools also give you an estimated monthly search volume.

Another tool to use is the [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home){:rel="external"}. This tool shows what search queries Google is returning and how many clicks and impressions they get. A click is when a user clicks on your link. An impression is the amount of times a webpage has appeared in search results. 

Each of these tools can help you know which keywords people are searching for and to write accordingly.

### Keyword categories

There are 3 main types of keyword categories. Try writing to at least 1 of these areas:

- navigational --- a search for a specific webpage, for example ‘mygov login’
- informational --- a search for topical information, for example ‘can I get paid maternity leave?’
- transactional --- a search for a ‘how to’, for example ‘import wine into Australia’

Some information may relate to a particular location or group of people. If so, make sure you include these details --- for example ‘student placements in northern NSW’.

### Writing keyword based content

After you know what your keywords are, make sure to write your page content around those words. Be careful not to overuse keywords. This can have a negative impact your SEO efforts.

Include your keywords once or twice, if it make sense, in the first paragraph of your content. Try to also include supporting content that includes related concepts and terms. For example if you're writing about Australian embassies in Europe, add terms such as ‘travelling overseas’ or ‘getting help for an emergency in Europe’. This helps search engines understand what the theme of your page is about. 

Take time to write content that is natural, easy to read, and user-centred.
