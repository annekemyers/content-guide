The user should be able to get an understanding of the content by scanning the headings.

### Make the title short and accurate

Write a clear title and lead summary. Tell the user what the page is about and who it's for.

Headings are the first words users read to check the relevance of content before they commit to reading it.

Make headings short and succinct enough to stand alone when read out of context, for example in search results and on social media.

Google searches only show 55 characters of the page title.

Use only 1 top level (`H1`) heading.

### Break up content with subheadings

Users lose track if there are too many heading levels.

Break up blocks of text and draw the reader in with short interesting headings.

Help the user to understand the relationship between sections of text.

Short content should only use 2 subheading levels (`H2` and `H3`).

### Frontload keywords in headings

Start headings and subheadings with keywords that help the user to make a connection.

This will also help search engines find your content.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "frontloading subheading"
  content= "
Digital communities of practice

Smart cities in Europe
"
%}

Avoid meaningless words such as 'more' and 'related information'. State what the paragraph says.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "good and bad headings"
  content= "
Like this:

> Smart cities in Europe

Not this:

> More information
"
%}

### Use sentence case for headings

Use sentence case (an initial capital then lower case) for headings, except when using proper nouns.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "using sentence case in heading"
  content= "
Common tax mistakes
"
%}
